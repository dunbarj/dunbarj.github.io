        <h4>Update Description</h4>
        <p>Hello everyone! This is the first update log for Mayor! Mayor! Thanks for reading this. The are a lot of changes with this update. Most of them are bug-related and just general QoL stuff, but there are also several major changes as well. The most notable change is that the 2-cost cities no longer have all of the buildings available to construct. I decided that granting all of the buildings so quickly and in a single map was detrimental to the fun of the game and the challenge behind the different objectives. Read below for the other changes.</p>
        <h4>Updates</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Updated available building lists for Dolina, Amrhein, and Montagne. Previously built buildings that are no longer allowed in those cities have been refunded 1.25 times their original cost.</li>
            <li>Swapped menu locations of Plainsfield and Hillsboro</li>
            <li>Visual Update made to Hotel and Hospital so that it is less confusing that their "road" doesn't count as an actual road.</li>
            <li>Updated Neighborhood so that it only requires a road on one side and only connects to the road on that side. This change was also made to avoid confusion around roads being on building tiles.</li>
            <li>Added a building count to the objectives list for objectives that require a certain number of buildings so users do not have to count themselves.</li>
            <li>Updated effect description text for Arcade and Bank to better reflect the buildings they truly effect.</li>
            <li>Changed Bus Station so that it gains earnings for all other Bus Stations but can not be placed within 5 spaces of other bus stations. Also changed UI to display error message if need be.</li>
            <li>Changed Bus Station text to better describe its new functionality.</li>
            <li>Changed the City Hall and Monument buildings so that only one instance of each is allowed to be built. Also updated UI to display error message if need be.</li>
            <li>Updated City Hall and Monument effect descriptions to reflect singleton changes.</li>
            <li>Added Settings option to toggle on/off a set of buttons that will rotate the in-game view.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Balancing Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Buffed the Library by making its cost and population requirement to be comparable with the Book Store. (Cost: $10,000, Pop. Need: 10,000).</li>
            <li>Nerfed the Fast-Food Restaurant, Sandwich Shop, and Pizzeria by upping their population need to 5000 from 3000.</li>
            <li>Buffed the Grocery Store by reducing its cost to $20,000 from $40,000.</li>
            <li>Buffed Brewery, Chinese Restaurant, Italian Restaurant, an Mexican Restaurant by reducing their cost to $10,000 from $20,000.</li>
            <li>Nerfed Brewery, Chinese Restaurant, Italian Restaurant, and Mexican Restaurant by reducing their earnings to $80 from $100.</li>
            <li>Buffed the Supercenter by reducing its cost from $200,000 to $100,000.</li>
            <li>Nerfed the Bus Station's effect by reducing its bonus earnings to $5 for each other Bus Station instead of $10.</li>
            <li>Buffed the Bus Station by reducing its cost to $7500 from $10000.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed Arcade effect description text from "2 spaces away" to "4 spaces away" to reflect the actual effect.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where the earnings logo was not being set properly for "pay-reward" buildings in the build menu (i.e., Research Center)</li>
            <li>Fixed text issue where "pay-reward" buildings had effect text that displayed "Unique" twice.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where the building "ghost's" rotation would be different than that of the previously placed building when Repositioning a building via the Edit Menu.</li>
            <li>Fixed visual issues with the grid tile so that the red tile mesh does not clip with the road.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where the Arcade would always display its bonus symbol even if its effect was not activated.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where a building's road direction arrows could be displayed incorrectly if the building was facing a non-existent tile (i.e., off the grid or onto a non-available tile).</li>
            
        </ul>
