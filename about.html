                <h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
                <div>
                    <p>Hi! My name is Jacob Dunbar and I am a senior at Purdue University studying Computer Science with concentrations in Software Engineering and Computer Graphics and Visualization.</p>
                    <p>I am a student leader in Purdue's All-American Marching Band, the "Computer Guru" for the honorary band service fraternity Kappa Kappa Psi, and a founding executive member of the Purdue Independent Game Developer's Club.</p>
                    <p>I have working/course experience in C/C++, Java, Python, ARM/x86 Assembly, HTML, and CSS.</p>
                    <p>I also have independent experience with C#, JavaScript, Node.js, and SQL/MySQL.</p>
                    <p>Computer Science concepts that I have a good grasp of include data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, tree, hash tables, etc), recursion, graphs, pattern matching, digital logic, pipelining, I/O redirection, pipes, memory allocation, threads, semaphores, mutex locks, socket programming, and iterative and concurrent servers.</p>

                <h3>Recent Accomplishments</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>This past summer I stayed on Purdue's campus taking classes (CS252: Systems Programming) and working as a teaching assistant for other Computer Science courses (CS 250: Computer Architecture and CS 251: Data Structures and Algorithms), as well as working a part time job. I will also be working as a teaching assistant for CS 252 this fall.</p>
                    <p>I've also recently gotten involved with a web application project in cooperation with IBM. Through the semester I will be teaching myself Django in order to help finish a project that could be used by universities across the country!</p>
