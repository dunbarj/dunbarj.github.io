                <div>
                    <p>Hi! My name is Jacob Dunbar and I am a senior at Purdue University studying Computer Science with concentrations in <b>Software Engineering</b> and <b>Computer Graphics and Visualization</b>.</p>
                    <p>I am a former student leader in Purdue's All-American Marching Band, "Computer Guru" for the honorary band service fraternity Kappa Kappa Psi, and founding executive member of the <a href="http://purduegamedev.club">Purdue Independent Game Developer's Club.</a></p>
                    <p>I have a lot of experience with Node.js and Unity development.</p>
                    <p>I am proficient with C/C++, C#, Java, Javascript, and Python.</p>
                    <p>I also have experience with Django, HTML/CSS, SQL/MySQL, and ARM/x86 Assembly.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Recent Accomplishments</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>During my final semester at Purdue I have been working on two senior capstone projects: one with a team and one individually. I have been working with Node.js and MySQL for the group project and Unity, C#, and C++ for the individual one.</p>
                    <p>This summer (2017) I worked as a Software Development Intern at Beckman Coulter Life Sciences in Indianapolis, IN. I did work with computer vision and projection mapping for my summer project.</p>
                    <p>This past spring semester I did coursework in Relational Databases, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering. Projects I did during that semester include a Pac-Man AI that automatically collects pellets while avoiding ghosts, a ground-up relational database management system (DBMS), and a top-down survival shooter game.
