        <h4>Update Description</h4>
        <p>Big update today! The main update with today is iOS support! You can now find Mayor! Mayor! on the App Store! This update also brings you toggleable citizens to your cities. Purely a fun addition, but breathes a lot of life into the game. 3 more cities (all 3-cost cities) have been added to the game as well! Most of the other changes are general ease-of-use items that I hope will make the overall experience a bit more enjoyable. Thanks for continuing to play Mayor! Mayor! Check out the detailed update list below.</p>
