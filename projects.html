                <h3><a href="http://hobofreddy55.itch.io/firates-alpha-gamejam-build">Firates!</a></h3>
                <p><i>Firates!</i> was a game I made over the summer (2015) for the game jam Insanity Jam 4. It was made using Unity2D and C# scripting! I learned both during the week or so that the jam took place.</p>
                <h3><a href="https://github.com/dunbarj/CS180/blob/master/SafeWalkServer.java">Safe Walk Server</a></h3>
                <p>This project involved making a simple server-client system that allowed users to request walking partners through Purdue's Safe Walk Program.</p>
                <h3><a href="https://github.com/dunbarj/ece264assignmentsPublic/tree/master/PA10">Yelp Search System</a></h3>
                <p>This was a project for ECE 264 (Advanced C Programming). I utilized a binary search tree in order to allow the user to find reviews for locations based on their search of name, state, or zip code.</p>
