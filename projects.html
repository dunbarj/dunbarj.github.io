		<h3><a href="http://mix-it-up.herokuapp.com/">Mix-It-Up</a></h3>
		<div>
		    <p>This webapp allows users to search for mixed drink recipes based on ingredients and name. This project was made using Node.js and the Absolut API and was created for a Software Testing class where we performed unit, regression, and other types of tests with our project during development. <a href="https://github.com/dunbarj/mix-it-up">Check it out on Github</a></p>

                <h3>Personal Shell Project</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>In this project I created a Csh-like shell from scratch, which included features like wildcarding (including subdirectories), subshells, I/O redirects, and piping.</p>
                    <p><i>Note: Unfortunately I can't put the project up on my Github account as it is a project done every semester. If you would be interested in seeing the code, just shoot me an email!</i></p>
                </div>
                <h3><a href="https://github.com/dunbarj/CS180/blob/master/SafeWalkServer.java">Safe Walk Server</a></h3>
                <div>
                    <p>This project involved making a simple server-client system that allowed users to request walking partners through Purdue's Safe Walk Program.</p>
                </div>
                <h3><a href="https://github.com/dunbarj/ece264assignmentsPublic/tree/master/PA10">Yelp Search System</a></h3>
                <div>
                    <p>This was a project for ECE 264 (Advanced C Programming). I utilized a binary search tree in order to allow the user to find reviews for locations based on their search of name, state, or zip code.</p>
                    <p>(answer10.c is my written code, view README for information about the project)</p>
                </div>
                <h1>Side Projects</h1>
		<h3><a href="http://marketplace.purduecs.com">IBM Capstone Marketplace</a></h3>
                <div>
                    <p>In cooperation with IBM, this project is being worked on by Prof. Gustavo Rodriguez-Rivera and two other undergraduate students (plus me). This project involves developing an online system that students, professors, and company representatives can use to more easily collaborate on senior design (capstone) projects. It is being developed using Python and Django.</p>
                </div>
		<h3><a href="https://github.com/dunbarj/smart-cloud">Smart-Cloud Project</a></h3>
		<div>
		    <p>The Smart-Cloud is a physical lamp that was created to look like a cloud. It is small (about a foot in diameter) and contains a Raspberry Pi and a strip of LEDs. This self-started project involves creating a web server that a user can interact with to change the functionality and color of the cloud. The cloud can currently represent weather data using its RGB LED strip by changing color based on the temperature. Soon it will be able to show the forecast (rain/snow/shine) and eventually be able to be voice controlled with an Amazon Echo Dot using Alexa.</p>

                <h3><a href="http://hobofreddy55.itch.io/firates-alpha-gamejam-build">Firates!</a></h3>
                <div>
                    <p><i>Firates!</i> was a small game I made over the summer (2015) for the game jam Insanity Jam 4. It was made using Unity and C# scripting, both of which I taught myself over the week that the game jam took place in.</p>
