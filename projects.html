                <h3>Personal Shell Project</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>In this project I created a Csh-like shell from scratch, which included features like wildcarding (including subdirectories), subshells, I/O redirects, and piping.</p>
                    <p><i>Note: Unfortunately I can't put the project up on my Github account as it is a project done every semester. If you would be interested in seeing the code, just shoot me an email!</i></p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/dunbarj/CS180/blob/master/SafeWalkServer.java">Safe Walk Server</a></h3>
                <div>
                    <p>This project involved making a simple server-client system that allowed users to request walking partners through Purdue's Safe Walk Program.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/dunbarj/ece264assignmentsPublic/tree/master/PA10">Yelp Search System</a></h3>
                <div>
                    <p>This was a project for ECE 264 (Advanced C Programming). I utilized a binary search tree in order to allow the user to find reviews for locations based on their search of name, state, or zip code.</p>
                    <p>(answer10.c is my written code, view README for information about the project)</p>

                <h3>IBM Capstone Marketplace</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>A project in cooperation with IBM that I am currently working on with Prof. Gustavo Rodriguez-Rivera. This project is currently in a planning phase but will enter development soon. It will be made using Python and Django.</p>

                <div>
                    <p><i>Firates!</i> was a small game I made over the summer (2015) for the game jam Insanity Jam 4. It was made using Unity and C# scripting, both of which I taught myself over the week that the game jam took place in.</p>
